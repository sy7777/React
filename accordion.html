																					</h4><p class="goto"> NBN is only available in selected
																						coverage areas. Please
																						<a href="/nbn#section2">check NBN availability</a>
																						in your area. Further availability checks will be
																						conducted upon registration.</p>

																					<h4>Minimum Charge for NBN Bundle/Plan calculated as:</h4>

																					<p>
																						<strong>With included modem</strong>
																						- ($(NBN plan monthly charge) + $(Optional voice add-on
																						charge) + $99.95 Setup Fee + $10 Equipment Delivery
																						Fee)</p>

																					<p>
																						<strong>Without included modem</strong>
																						- ($(NBN plan monthly charge))</p>

																						<a href="/nbn#usage-and-charges-nbn">New Development

																					<h4>NBN Speeds:</h4>

																					<p>Typical Evening Download Speeds are subject to change
																						and are measured 7pm-11pm. Typical Evening Upload Speeds
																						are estimated by reference to the maximum upload
																						speed.&nbsp;Your service speeds are not guaranteed and may
																						vary due to many factors including type/source of content
																						being downloaded, hardware and software configuration, the
																						number of users and performance of interconnecting
																						infrastructure not operated by TPG. Devices connected by
																						Wi-Fi may experience slower speeds than those connected by
																						Ethernet cable. For customers on a NBN FTTN/B/C
																						connection, we will inform you of your maximum attainable
																						line speed once it’s available from NBN after activation.
																						If you are on a higher speed NBN plan that your line can’t
																						support, we’ll provide you with options, including to
																						downgrade or cancel your service for no extra charge and
																						with a refund. For Fixed Wireless customers, your user
																						experience could also vary due to congestion and fixed
																						wireless network limitations.&nbsp;Our NBN100 plan is
																						configured on the NBN 100/20 wholesale tier which provides
																						upload speeds between 1Mbps and 20Mbps.</p>

																					<h4>CSG:</h4>

																					<p>Above monthly charge and setup pricing is based on
																						customers agreeing to waive the Customer Service Guarantee
																						(CSG). For more information please contact TPG Sales on 13
																						14 23.</p>

																								<h4>Schedule an appointment</h4>

																								<p>After you submitted your NBN Bundle application to

																									that you would require technician's visit.</p>

																								<p>If an installation appointment is required, you or an
																									authorised person over 18 years of age will be required

																							</li>
																							<li>
																								<h4>Before your installation appointment</h4>

																								<p>You will need to think about where you want the NBN

																									accessible power point, in a cool, dry, ventilated area
																									and away from busy areas where it may be knocked and
																									damaged.</p>

																								<p>You need to be aware of fact that the NBN connection

																								components:

																								<ul>
																									<li>NBN Outdoor antenna (also known as ODU)</li>
																									<li>Cable that connects the outdoor antenna into your

																							</li>
																							<li>
																								<h4>Things to expect during installation</h4>

																								<p>NBN has a strict "leave it as it's found" policy so
																									there is no need to be concerned about any permanent
																									damage to your property. A standard installation
																									normally takes between approximately 2 and 4 hours. If
																									you request the NBN technician to perform a
																									non-standard installation, the time required may be
																									longer.</p>

																								<p>Also remember, some furniture may need to be moved
																									and some drilling work might be required to mount the
																									equipment, so be prepared for noise and dusts. Some
																									places might not be possible due to safety or other
																									considerations such as if there is additional wiring
																									work required.</p>

																									cabling and check that your premises is properly
																									connected to the NBN.</p>
																							</li>
																							<li>
																								<h4>NBN supplied equipment</h4>

																								<p>NBN Co installer will install all the equipment
																									required to connect your premises to the NBN network,
																									which may include a:</p>

																								<ul>
																									<li>NBN Utility Box (also known as Premises Connection
																										Device - PCD)</li>
																									<li>NBN Connection Box (also known as Network
																										Termination Device - NTD)</li>
																								</ul><img alt="NBN Install Diagram"
																									data-entity-type="file"
																									data-entity-uuid="931017dd-d516-47c7-8042-021d13bf95c7"
																									height="374"
																									src="/sites/tpg/files/inline-images/nbn-diagram.png"><p>The
																									technicians are not required to install any further
																									equipment.</p>
																							</li>
																							<li>
																								<h4>Things to expect during installation</h4>

																								<p>If your building doesn't already have a fibre-optic
																									cable connected, running the cable into your premises
																									may require the digging of a small trench, or, if it's
																									coming from overhead, some minor clearing of
																									vegetation. NBN Co has a strict
																									"leave it as it's found" policy so there is no need to
																									be concerned about any permanent damage to your
																									property. If your premises already have fibre-optic
																									cable connected to a Premises Connection Device (PCD),
																									standard installations normally take between
																									approximately 2 and 4 hours. If your premises do not
																									have the fibre optic cable connected then a standard
																									installation could take between 4 and 8 hours. If you
																									request the NBN Co technician to perform a non-standard
																									installation, the time required may be longer.</p>

																								<p>Also remember, some furniture may need to be moved
																									and some drilling work might be required to mount the
																									equipment, so be prepared for noise and dusts. Some
																									places might not be possible due to safety or other
																									considerations such as if there is additional wiring
																									work required.</p>

																							Special Note:</h4>

																						<ul>
																							<li>TPG Voice Service on NBN FTTN, FTTB, FTTC, Cable
																								(HFC) and Fixed Wireless is a Digital Voice Service
																								which is delivered using Voice over Internet Protocol
																								(VoIP) technology. Digital Voice Service requires a
																								broadband connection and power to the Wi-Fi modem router
																								supplied by TPG. If there is a broadband connection
																								outage in your premises due to power or other faults,
																								the Digital Voice Service will not work and you cannot
																								make phone calls including "000" emergency calls.</li>
																							<li>TPG Voice Service supports fax to national numbers in
																								the Telstra, Optus, AAPT and Primus PSTN network. Fax to
																								international numbers is not reliable and VoIP based fax
																								is not supported. This plan does not support the
																								Priority Assistance Scheme.</li>
																							<li>TPG Voice Service does not support old dial up
																								technology devices with built in modems such as EFTPOS,
																								Back to Base Alarms and Foxtel Program purchase. These
																								devices have been replaced by Internet Protocol (IP)
																								enabled devices and many TPG customers are able to use
																								EFTPOS, Back to Base alarms and Foxtel Program purchase
																								through the internet provided that their devices are IP
																								enabled. For further details on IP enabled devices
																								contact your device supplier. TPG Voice Service also
																								does not support analogue modems, Priority Assistance
																								Scheme, calls to 19/1900, 0500 numbers and Universal
																								International Freephone Numbers (UIFN).</li>
																							<li>Once an NBN Bundle plan is purchased, you cannot
																								separately cancel either component (NBN Broadband or
																								Voice Service). Cancellation will cease both services.
																								You cannot purchase either TPG NBN Broadband or Voice
																								Service as a standalone service.</li>
																						</ul>
																						<h4>TPG Voice Service Number:</h4>

																						<p>At registration time, you can choose to port your
																							existing number to TPG or have TPG supply a Direct Inward
																							Dial Number (DID) for use with the Voice Service. This
																							number will be allocated to you based on the address
																							which you provide us at the time of registration. TPG
																							will make use of your number as a reference point to
																							charge for local calls. TPG will use its best endeavours
																							to supply the Integrated Public Number Database (IPND)
																							with your address details for the purpose of emergency
																							services (000) calling.</p>

																						<h4>Number Porting:</h4>

																						<p>You can port (transfer) your phone number from Telstra,
																							Optus, AAPT, Primus or Powertel to TPG. We may not be
																							able to port your number in all circumstances, including
																							where you fail to provide correct account details, or as
																							a result of contractual obligations with your existing
																							provider. If you are porting your number to TPG, inbound
																							calling to your number will not commence until porting is
																							complete which will take a further 1 to 5 business
																							days.</p>

																						<li><h4>What is the NBN?
																							</h4><p>The National Broadband Network (NBN) is a
																								national communications infrastructure currently being
																								built by nbn™ on behalf of the Federal Government.
																							</p>
																						</li>
																						<li><h4>When is the NBN coming to my area?
																							</h4><p>
																								NBN Co has scheduled the roll out of the network around
																								the country. To find out when your area will be covered
																								by the NBN, check the<a href="/nbn#coverage-nbn"> NBN
																									Co's coverage map</a>
																							</p>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<h4>When can I sign up for TPG NBN service?</h4>

																							<p>You can sign up to TPG NBN service when it is
																								available in your area. To check for availability,
																								please enter your address
																								<a href="/nbn#section2">here</a>.</p>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<h4>Do I have to switch to the NBN?</h4>

																							<p>If you live in an area where NBN has been rolled out
																								and you wish to keep your landline or Internet service,
																								you will need to switch to the NBN before the copper
																								based services in your area are disabled. This may occur
																								about 18 months after NBN becomes available in your
																								area.</p>

																							<p>You will not need to switch to NBN If you live in an
																								area where NBN Fixed Wireless has been rolled out.
																								Copper based services will not be disabled in Fixed
																								Wireless areas, however we recommend to make the switch
																								and enjoy the speeds of the NBN.</p>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<h4>Are the speeds provided by the NBN guaranteed?</h4>

																							<p>Actual throughput speeds may be slower and could vary
																								due to many factors including type/source of content
																								being downloaded, hardware and software configuration,
																								the number of users simultaneously using the network and
																								performance of interconnecting infrastructure not
																								operated by TPG. Devices connected by Wi-Fi may
																								experience slower speeds than those connected by
																								Ethernet cable. For FTTB and FTTN customers, we will
																								inform you of your maximum line sync speed once
																								available. If you are on a higher speed NBN plan, you
																								have the option to downgrade to a lower speed plan
																								without any penalties</p>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<h4>What are the various access technologies used by the
																								NBN?</h4>

																							<p>The rollout of the NBN network uses a mix of access
																								technologies to deliver a fast and reliable internet
																								service, wherever you live in Australia. The type of
																								access technology that will connect your home or
																								business to the NBN network will depend on your
																								location.</p>

																							<p>TPG delivers NBN services on the following access
																								technologies:</p>

																							<ul>
																								<li>Fibre to the Premises (FTTP): FTTP delivers fast
																									broadband by running fibre-optic cable from a fibre
																									node directly to the end-user premises.</li>
																								<li>Fibre to the Node (FTTN): FTTN is a way of
																									delivering access to fast broadband by running
																									fibre-optic cable to a neighbourhood node/cabinet and
																									from there using the existing copper network to the
																									end-user premises.</li>
																								<li>Fibre to the Building (FTTB): FTTB is a way of
																									delivering access to fast broadband by running
																									fibre-optic cable to the basement of multi-dwelling
																									units such as apartment blocks and from there using the
																									existing copper wire to the end-user premises.</li>
																								<li>Fibre to the Curb (FTTC): FTTC is a way of
																									delivering access to fast broadband by running
																									fibre-optic cable to an outdoor pit near the end user’s
																									premises and from there using the existing copper
																									network to the end-user premises.</li>
																								<li>Cable/Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC): HFC is a network
																									technology that allows access to fast broadband
																									services using a combination of fibre and coaxial cable
																									to connect your home to the NBN network.</li>
																								<li>Fixed Wireless: NBN Fixed Wireless services are
																									delivered by radio communications from an nbn™ Fixed
																									Wireless facility directly to a small outdoor antenna
																									attached to your premises. The nbn™ Fixed Wireless
																									network uses advanced technology commonly referred to
																									as LTE or 4G, and is engineered to deliver services to
																									a fixed number of premises within each coverage area.
																									This means that the bandwidth per household is designed
																									to be more consistent than mobile wireless, even in
																									peak times of use. Unlike a mobile wireless service
																									where speeds can be affected by the number of people
																									moving into and out of the area, the speed available in
																									a Fixed Wireless network is designed to remain
																									relatively steady.</li>
																							</ul>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<h4>What speed options can TPG NBN provide?</h4>

																							<p>TPG offers following speed options for NBN FTTP, FTTN,
																								FTTB, FTTC and Cable (HFC) technologies:</p>

																							<ul>
																								<li>NBN12 (Basic) - Typical evening speed 12Mbps
																									download&nbsp;and 0.8Mbps upload#</li>
																								<li>NBN25 (Standard) - Typical evening speed 25Mbps
																									download&nbsp;and 4Mbps upload#</li>
																								<li>NBN50 (Standard Plus) - Typical evening speed 50Mbps
																									download&nbsp;and 17Mbps upload#</li>
																								<li>NBN100 (Premium) - Typical evening speed 97Mbps
																									download&nbsp;and 17Mbps upload#</li>
																								<li>Superfast (Premium) - Typical evening speed 232Mbps
																									download&nbsp;and 21Mbps upload#</li>
																								<li>Ultrafast (Premium) - Typical evening speed 671Mbps
																									download&nbsp;and 40Mbps upload#</li>
																							</ul>
																							<p>TPG offers the following speed options for NBN Fixed
																								Wireless technology:</p>

																							<ul>
																								<li>NBN12 - Basic typical evening speed#</li>
																								<li>NBN25 - Basic typical evening speed#</li>
																							</ul>
																							# Typical Evening Download Speeds are subject to change
																							and are measured 7pm-11pm. Typical Evening Upload Speeds
																							are estimated by reference to the maximum upload speed.
																							Your service speeds are not guaranteed and may vary due
																							to many factors including type/source of content being
																							downloaded, hardware and software configuration, the
																							number of users and performance of interconnecting
																							infrastructure not operated by TPG. Devices connected by
																							Wi-Fi may experience slower speeds than those connected
																							by Ethernet cable. For FTTB, FTTN and FTTC customers, we
																							will inform you of your maximum line sync speed once
																							available. If you are on a higher speed NBN plan, you
																							have the option to downgrade to a lower speed plan
																							without any penalties. For Fixed Wireless customers, your
																							user experience could also vary due to congestion and
																							fixed wireless network limitations.</li>

																						<li><h5>Can I get TPG NBN?
																							</h5><p>TPG NBN service is only available:
																							</p>

																							<ul class="sprtlist02"> <li>In selected NBN coverage
																									areas</li>
																								<li>If you are an existing TPG ADSL2+ customer and
																									interested in the NBN service, please
																									<a
																										href="https://support.tpg.com.au/n/changing-your-internet-plan-my-account"
																										target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">update your
																										plan on My Account</a>
																									or call our Customer Service on 1300 920 158.</li>
																							</ul>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<h5>I'm renting, how do I get the NBN?</h5>

																							<p>For NBN Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) and Fixed
																								Wireless, you will need to get permission from the
																								property owner to install NBN equipment in your
																								premises. We recommend that you discuss with your
																								property manager or landlord about installation of TPG
																								NBN service.</p>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<h5>Will TPG supply me with a modem to work with the
																								NBN?</h5>

																							<p>You may choose to bring your own compatible modem, or
																								have a 4 port WiFi Modem supplied by us for a Setup Fee
																								of $99.95 and a $10 Delivery Fee.</p>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<h5>How long will the installation of my NBN service
																								take?</h5>

																							<p>Installation of NBN service generally takes less than
																								10 business days but can take longer in some cases,
																								depending on the demand of NBN services in your area and
																								the availability of the NBN technician to perform the
																								installation.</p>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<h5>Will TPG notify me of the installation date during
																								the application process?</h5>

																							<p>Yes. You will be sent an email notification confirming
																								the installation date and timeframe. We will also notify
																								you if a technician appointment is required to install
																								your NBN service. You, or an authorised person over 18
																								years of age will be required to be at the premises on
																								the day of the technician visit.</p>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<h5>Is a technician appointment required to install the
																								NBN service?</h5>

																							<p>A technician might be required to attend to your
																								premises to complete the installation and make sure you
																								are connected to the NBN network. After you have
																								submitted your order, TPG will confirm if an
																								installation appointment is needed. If so, TPG will
																								organise this and contact you with the appointment
																								details.</p>

																							<p>If an installation appointment is required, you or an
																								authorised person over 18 years of age will be required
																								to be at the premises on the day of the technician
																								visit. On the installation day, an NBN installer will
																								come to your home to do the necessary work.</p>

																							<p>If your premises have an active NBN service connected
																								previously then it is unlikely that you would require
																								technician's visit.</p>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<h5>Will my TPG NBN service work when there is a power
																								failure?</h5>

																							<p>TPG NBN service on FTTN, FTTB, FTTC, HFC and Fixed
																								Wireless technologies will NOT work in the event of a
																								power outage. The Voice Service requires a broadband
																								connection and power to the Wi-Fi modem supplied by TPG.
																								If there is a broadband connection outage in your
																								premises due to power or other faults, the Digital Voice
																								Service will not work and you cannot make phone calls
																								including "000" emergency calls.</p>

																							<p>NBN services require a backup battery unit to keep
																								power going to your NBN Network Termination Device in
																								the event of a power outage so that some elements of
																								your telephone service can continue to operate for an
																								estimated period of time of about 5 hours during the
																								power outage. TPG NBN service does not include the
																								supply of a backup battery unit. This means during a
																								power outage, you will not be able to make or receive
																								any calls, including calls to emergency services. Please
																								ensure that you have an alternative method to make calls
																								such as a mobile phone.</p>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<h5>What is my Network Boundary Point?</h5>

																							<p>TPG is responsible to deliver the service to the
																								Network Boundary Point. The Network Boundary Point is
																								dependent on the NBN access technology used to deliver
																								the service.</p>

																							<ul>
																								<li>FTTN/FTTC: Your first Telecommunications Outlet
																									which can be the first wall socket in a free standing
																									premises (e.g. house) or your side of the Main

																						<li><h4>Can I port (transfer) my existing phone number to
																								TPG?
																							</h4><p>You can port (transfer) your phone number from
																								Telstra, Optus, AAPT, Primus or Powertel to TPG. We may
																								not be able to port your number in all circumstances,
																								this includes failure to provide account details, or
																								contractual obligations with your existing provider. If
																								you are porting your number to TPG, inbound calling to
																								your number will not commence until porting is complete
																								which will take additional 1 to 5 business days after
																								your TPG NBN service is installed.
																							</p>
																						</li>
																						<li><h4>Can I use my existing phone wall socket for TPG
																								Voice service?
																							</h4>

																							<p><u>If you have NBN FTTN, FTTB, FTTC, HFC or Fixed
																									Wireless:</u>
																								<br>You can use your current telephone handset, however
																								it will have to be plugged into the VoIP port on the
																								supplied Wi-Fi Modem Router using a standard telephone
																								cable.
																							</p>

																							<p><u>If you have NBN FTTP:</u>
																								<br>You can use your current telephone handset, however
																								it will have to be plugged directly to one of the UNI-V
																								ports on your NBN Connection Box (NTD). When your NBN
																								service is activated, we will advise you of which port
																								to use. If you wish to connect your phone to an existing
																								wall socket, you should check if your in-premises wiring
																								is connected to the NBN service. If it is not connected
																								to NBN, you may need to install additional permanent
																								phone or data cabling through wall, floor or ceiling
																								cavities which must be done by a cabler registered with
																								an Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA)
																								accredited industry registrar.
																							</p>
																						</li>
																						<li><h4>To be able to port my number, what information do
																								I need to provide?
																							</h4><p>You will need to provide your current Account
																								Number provided by your current phone provider. This can
																								be found on any bill you receive from your phone
																								provider for your phone service. Providing an incorrect
																								Account Number may result in delays with the porting
																								process and lengthen the period in which you will not be
																								able to receive any incoming phone calls.
																							</p>
																						</li>
																						<li><h4>Can I keep the phone number assigned by TPG when I
																								no longer want to have the Voice service with TPG?
																							</h4><p>You need to check with the new or gaining
																								provider if they are able to port from TPG.
																							</p>
																						</li>
																						<li><h4>While my phone number is being ported to TPG, can
																								I still make outgoing calls?
																							</h4><p>Yes, as soon as TPG NBN service has been
																								installed, you will be able to make outgoing calls from
																								your TPG Voice Service. TPG will charge you for any call
																								usage. However, inbound calling to your number will not
																								commence on TPG Voice Service until porting is completed
																								which will take an additional 1 to 5 business days after
																								your TPG NBN Service is installed.
																							</p>
																						</li>
																						<li><h4>What Spend Management Tools does TPG offer?
																							</h4><p>
																								With TPG Voice Service, you can monitor your actual
																								usage (in near real time), bar outbound calls of various
																								types, and make use of other spend management tools via
																								My Account at<a href="/account" target="_blank">
																									www.tpg.com.au/account</a>. For more information about
																								using these tools, please contact Customer Service on 13
																								14 23.</p>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<h4>Once TPG NBN Voice Service is installed, are there
																								any services that will not work on my TPG Voice
																								Service?</h4>

																							<p>TPG Voice Service does not support old dial up
																								technology devices with built in modems such as EFTPOS,
																								Back to Base Alarms and Foxtel Program purchase. These
																								devices have been replaced by Internet Protocol (IP)
																								enabled devices and many TPG customers are able to use
																								EFTPOS, Back to Base alarms and Foxtel Program purchase
																								through the internet provided that their devices are IP
																								enabled. For further details on IP enabled devices
																								contact your device supplier. TPG Voice Service also
																								does not support analogue modems, Priority Assistance
																								Scheme, calls to 19/1900, 0500 numbers and Universal
																								International Freephone Numbers (UIFN).</p>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<h4>Can I watch Foxtel if I have TPG NBN bundle
																								service?</h4>

																							<p>Yes, watching regular Foxtel programs is not affected
																								by TPG NBN Bundle service. Regular Foxtel programs use
																								an entirely separate connection from your NBN or Voice
																								connection.</p>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<h4>Does Foxtel On Demand or program purchase work with
																								TPG NBN?</h4>

																							<p>If you have the latest Foxtel set top box, you can
																								purchase and download programs using the Ethernet or
																								Wi-Fi connection (set top box dependant) in the set top
																								box to connect via TPG NBN Broadband.<br><br>
																								If you have the older Foxtel set top box without an
																								Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection, program purchase through
																								your landline will not work with TPG Voice service. We
																								suggest you contact Foxtel about upgrading your set top
																								box.</p>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<a id="3.10" name="3.10"></a>
																							<h4>Once I register for NBN Bundle, can I cancel the NBN
																								service or Voice service component?</h4>

																							<p>No, the NBN or Voice service cannot be cancelled
																								separately. Since TPG NBN is a bundle plan, cancellation
																								will cease both services.</p>
																						</li>
																						<li>
																							<a id="3.11" name="3.11"></a>
																							<h4>Do I need to call my current provider to cancel my
																								existing home phone service or Internet?</h4>

																							<p>Once your TPG NBN bundle service has been activated,
																								if you currently have any existing services such as
																								phone or internet at your premises, you will need to
																								contact your current provider to have these services
																								cancelled to ensure you do not receive any further
																								bills. TPG recommends you check with your current phone
																								and/or internet service provider regarding contractual
																								commitments and termination/disconnection fees
																								associated with your current services. TPG is not
																								responsible for these charges. If you are also porting
																								your existing phone number to TPG, do not cancel your
																								phone service until the number has been ported.</p>

																								prepayment, it will be forfeited to us when you cancel
																								the service. You agree that no bill will be provided for
																								this service and that direct debiting of your account or
																								charge to your credit card may occur notwithstanding
																								that no bill is provided and that it may occur even
																								though you may not have had the opportunity to check
																								charges at least 10 working days before the debit. We
